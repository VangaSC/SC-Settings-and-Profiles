### KEYBINDINGS (Important Combat Keys)
- Vehicles - Seats and Operator Modes
	- Enter Remote Turret 1, 2, 3 (Default unbound)
	- Look Behind (Default Comma ",") -- Fire missiles while disengaging (missile axis degrees are from vision center, not vehicle nose; some copilots with missiles / remote turrets can take great advantage of this!)
- Flight - Movement
	- G-Force safety off (or toggle) ("off" allows for quicker maneuvers in smaller ships at risk of pilot blackout, generally preferred "off" for PvP)[^1]
	- Gravity Compensation - Toggle ("on" causes thrusters to always fire in atmosphere, attempting to level altitude. Will interfere with combat maneuvers, "off" for PvP)[^1]
- Vehicles - Weapons
	- Auto Gimbal Toggle (functions as auto-convergence on/off)[^1]
	- Cycle Fire Mode
	- Toggle Lead / Lag PIPs[^1]
	- PIP Precision Lines Toggle (shows roll desired for proper alignment)[^1]
	- PIP Fading Toggle (PIPs disappear when target is off gun bore, 30Â° or so)[^1]
	- Gunnery UI Magnification Toggle (larger PIP circle for visibility)[^1]
	- Precision Targeting - Toggle [^1]
